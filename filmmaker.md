> "I love creating stories with the power of words  and telling them with the power of a camera." - Alessio Rubicini

In my free time, I enjoy writing screenplays for feature-length movies and short films. Screenwriting it's like a journal for my thoughts. It allows me to tell stories in a pure way  and to share the crazy, beautiful things that flow through my mind on a daily basis.

Sometimes I also shoot the stories I write, as you can see below.
