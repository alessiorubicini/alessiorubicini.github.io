I love watching movies. And I love making them just as much. Don't get me wrong, I haven't done any feature films (yet). But I love telling stories visually. Write them on paper and narrate them with a camera. It doesn't matter if it's a short film, a movie or a music video. As long as there's a story underneath and a camera above, I'm in.
