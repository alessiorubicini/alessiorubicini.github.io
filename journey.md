As part of the Knowledge Modeling and Management (advanced programming) exam project, I developed a Java application that allows astronomy researchers to maintain their own catalog of exoplanets, helping them in their cataloguing and classification. The application relies on a OWL ontology that describes the domain of exoplanet study and research and allows inference of new information such as the classification of planets and their potential habitability.
