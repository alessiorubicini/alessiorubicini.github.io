As part of the User eXperience Design exam project, I designed an application that allows local merchants, especially those affected by natural disasters such as the Central Italy earthquake, to advertise their business and products, and consumers to discover these realities and buy offered products with awareness. The design process included the use of typical UX Design tools and techniques such as Lean Canvas, SMART goals, personas and user stories.

As part of the Social Media Management exam project, some of my colleagues and I created a new social media campaign for the Too Good To Go service. In particular, we both valued existing features, such as donations to charities like *Croce Rossa Italiana*, and introduced new tools such as a chatbot called *Goody* integrated in the Too Good Too Go mobile app and a green tick called *Checky* to indicate the absence or presence of allergens.

As part of my Internet, Networks and Security exam, I did a little research on forensic analysis of iOS and Android mobile devices. In particular, I had the opportunity to study the internal organization of the two systems and explore, using some official and unofficial tools, the extraction of various types of data from the devices.

During the summer breaks, I dedicate my free time to developing apps for Apple platforms and Swift packages. In particular in summer 2021 and 2022 I developed a package that provides integrated alerts with the Dynamic Island for SwiftUI, a package for geographical coordinates input in SwiftUI and a package for selecting SF Symbols in SwiftUI. For more details about those packages, check out my [developer](/developer) page.

As a project of the Communication and Digital Marketing exam, some of my colleagues and I created a web series for our university's communication campaign. The realization, which I supervised as screenwriter and director, included a process of brainstorming, research, context and target analysis, planning and creativity with all the appropriate tools such as benchmarks, briefs and rationales. The final product is available on UNICAM's Youtube channel and season two is currently in the works.
