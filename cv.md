## Communication & interpersonal skills
**Teamwork** During my studies I worked several times in teams on various projects with my colleagues. In most cases, I also took on the role of project manager.

**Keep up to date** I follow Apple's annual developer conferences with great interest, and I visit news websites and technology blogs daily to keep up with what is happening in the world and especially in my field of work.

**Personal projects** I'm constantly looking for ideas for personal projects to work on in my free time and where I can put myself on the line to improve my skills or learn new ones.

**Presentations** During my studies I had several times the opportunity to make presentations to illustrate research and projects, intended not only for a school audience but sometimes also for the local press.
